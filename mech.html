            <h3>Event Details.</h3>

            <p class="event-des">Auction Inn is a fun based game which needs ones strategy and concentration for winning the bid. This is an event where people come and bid for a particular object from the budget given to them. This is where they will have to build some strategy and safe game-play for winning the bid. One starts thinking.
                    This event consists of one round where 8 teams will be bidding for one thing or an object. They will be given a fixed amount in which they have to bid for an output of great rating.
                    In this game each candidate will be given a fixed budget in which he will asked to bid for parts of a racing vehicle or a rocket or a cricket team or a football team. Once the bidding is done, rating of each team is calculated and winner is declared with this rating as reference. Each team consists of two members and entry fee for each team is Rs.50 and the winning price among the 8 teams is Rs.200.
                    As we have to accommodate 8 teams in one round, we need DH-1, a projector, a desktop, a mic set and a podium. We need a pretty good amount of stationary and Rs.2000 cash.<br>
